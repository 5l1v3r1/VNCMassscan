# VNCMassscan
Little python script to scan the internet and find people with unsecured vnc connection.

This app will make screenshots of others with their IP :D

You have to install vncdotool and massscan for this script to work. https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan



It was created just for fun and I don't take responsibility for any missuse.
